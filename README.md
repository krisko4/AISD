This is an implementation of _Left Leaning Red Black Tree_ data structure and _Map_ based on _Left Leaning Red Black Tree_. For testing purposes, words.txt file can be found in project directory. During tests, 1 000 000 words were first put and then popped from the tree in three variants - ordered, reverse-ordered and random. The average execution time of all the operations has been measured for each case. More detailed analysis can be found in _notatka.pdf_ file.
