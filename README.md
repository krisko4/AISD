## Algorithms &amp; data structures

The following repository mentions some of the algorithms I have implemented during labs on my master degree studies. The algorithms are written in Java and tested using JUnit.

## List of implemented algorithms & data structures

- binary search
- sorting
  - quicksort
  - insertion sort
  - selection sort
  - heapsort
  - mergesort
- hash list chaining
- hash open addressing
  - linear hashing
  - double hashing
  - quadratic hashing
- red black tree
- huffman
- longest common subsequence
- minimum spanning tree
  - Kruskal algorithm
  - Prim algorithm
- finite state machine
