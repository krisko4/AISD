![maxresdefault](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/80395610/152000175-541baa78-4982-4fba-acfc-a0e1830146cf.jpg)

This is an implementation of HashTable using three open addressing methods - linear hashing, double hashing and quadratic hashing. For each method, performance tests of putting and getting 100 000 words from _words.txt_ file have been conducted.
