## Sorting algorithms implementation

In this section four sorting algorithms have been implemented - Quicksort, InsertionSort, SelectionSort and HeapSort.
Each algorithm has been tested for its' time complexity and validity. A document containing all the charts and efficiency comparison between implemented algorithms can be
found in the **Sorting** directory.
